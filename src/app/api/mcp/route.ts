/**
 * The MCP endpoint.
 *
 * **Stateless, by necessity.** Serverless functions are ephemeral: any session
 * map would live in one invocation's memory and be gone from the next, and a
 * long-lived SSE stream would be cut off by the execution timeout. So no
 * `sessionIdGenerator` (which is what puts the transport in stateless mode),
 * `enableJsonResponse` so a plain JSON body comes back instead of a stream,
 * and a fresh server per request.
 *
 * The per-request construction is the point, not a cost: the server closes
 * over the authenticated principal, so every tool is scoped to one user's rows
 * by construction rather than by remembering to filter.
 *
 * The Web-standard transport takes a `Request` and returns a `Response`, which
 * is what a route handler already has. The Node transport of the same name
 * wants `IncomingMessage`/`ServerResponse` and does not fit here.
