/**
 * Session refresh and optimistic auth redirects.
 *
 * NOTE: this file is `proxy.ts`, not `middleware.ts`. The `middleware` file
 * convention is deprecated in Next.js 16 and renamed to `proxy`. Every Supabase
 * auth guide still shows `middleware.ts` with an exported `middleware`
 * function; that form no longer applies here.
 *
 * Two jobs, in order of importance:
 *
 *  1. Refresh the auth token and write the rotated cookie. Server Components
 *     cannot set cookies, so without this the session would quietly expire and
 *     `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` would swallow the resulting error.
 *
 *  2. Redirect signed-out visitors to /login. This is an OPTIMISTIC check and
 *     is not a security boundary — proxy runs on prefetched routes and should
 *     stay cheap. Real authorization happens in the data access layer, next to
 *     the data. See `src/lib/auth/dal.ts`.

 *
 * `/api/mcp` authenticates with a bearer token, not a cookie. Redirecting an
