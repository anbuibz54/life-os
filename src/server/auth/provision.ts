/**
 * User provisioning.
 *
 * `public.users` mirrors the auth provider's user. The row is created here, on
 * first authenticated request, rather than by a database trigger on
 * `auth.users`.
 *
 * Why not a trigger: it would have to live in the `auth` schema, which Supabase
 * owns. That puts it outside our migrations (it needs elevated grants), so it
 * would be applied by hand in a dashboard — invisible to the repo, missing from
 * a fresh clone, and gone entirely the day we leave Supabase. This function is
 * ordinary application code that runs on any Postgres.
 *
 * ---
 * PORTABILITY SEAM. `AuthPrincipal.id` is currently a Supabase Auth UUID, and
 * it is what every `user_id` foreign key points at. Moving to another auth
 * provider means either preserving those UUIDs or remapping them, and this
 * function is the one place that knows the mapping. If a second provider is
 * ever needed at the same time, the shape to add is (provider, subject) columns
 * with a surrogate `users.id` — not a second copy of this logic elsewhere.
 * ---
 *
 * No `next/*` imports. This file does not know what is serving it.
